  ### Security

  >[!WARNING]
  >Do not put this on the Internet if you do not know what you are doing.

  By default this container has no authentication and the optional environment variables `CUSTOM_USER` and `PASSWORD` to enable basic http auth via the embedded NGINX server should only be used to locally secure the container from unwanted access on a local network. If exposing this to the Internet we recommend putting it behind a reverse proxy, such as [SWAG](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag), and ensuring a secure authentication solution is in place. From the web interface a terminal can be launched and it is configured for passwordless sudo, so anyone with access to it can install and run whatever they want along with probing your local network.

  ### Nvidia GPU Support

  **Nvidia support is not compatible with Alpine based images as Alpine lacks Nvidia drivers**

  Nvidia support is available by leveraging Zink for OpenGL support. This can be enabled with the following run flags:

  | Variable | Description |
  | :----: | --- |
  | --gpus all | This can be filtered down but for most setups this will pass the one Nvidia GPU on the system |
  | --runtime nvidia | Specify the Nvidia runtime which mounts drivers and tools in from the host |

  The compose syntax is slightly different for this as you will need to set nvidia as the default runtime:

  ```
  sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker --set-as-default
  sudo service docker restart
  ```

  And to assign the GPU in compose:

  ```
  services:
    webtop:
      image: lscr.io/linuxserver/suyu:latest
      deploy:
        resources:
          reservations:
            devices:
              - driver: nvidia
                count: 1
                capabilities: [compute,video,graphics,utility]
  ```
